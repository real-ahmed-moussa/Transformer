> Implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch. This project demonstrates the key building blocks of Transformers—positional encoding, multi-head attention, encoder and decoder layers—without relying on high-level libraries like Hugging Face.

---

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a clear, modular implementation of the Transformer model in PyTorch. It can serve as an **educational reference** for understanding sequence-to-sequence architectures, attention mechanisms, and model training workflows.

The notebook includes detailed class definitions for:  
- Positional Encoding
- Multi-Head Attention
- Feedforward Layers
- Encoder & Decoder Blocks
- Full Encoder–Decoder Transformer

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Pure PyTorch Implementation:** No reliance on pre-built Transformer classes.  
✅ **Educational Design:** Each subcomponent (e.g., positional encoding, attention) is implemented and explained.  
✅ **Customizable Architecture:** Adjust number of layers, heads, and embedding sizes.  
✅ **Training Loop Ready:** Compatible with PyTorch DataLoader and optimizers (Adam).  


## 🏢 Applications
This implementation can be used to:  
- Build a translation model (e.g., English–Spanish).
- Experiment with sequence modeling tasks (summarization, text generation).
- Serve as a learning tool for students and practitioners studying Transformers.
